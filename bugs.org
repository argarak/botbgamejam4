oh btw the game crashes when you reach level 35

** current list of minor bugs:

- players don't take damage unless player is on enemy tile during enemy activation tick
- knockback can knock enemies into the void
- players collide with corners between 2+ rooms, probably wontfix
- if pushing up against a wall and moving in the x axis, it is possible to get stuck in the edge between rooms
- old non-format trophy tiles are called "silver/gold/bronze 0"

** really have to be done by sunday 8pm todos
