** current list of minor bugs:

- players don't take damage unless player is on enemy tile during enemy activation tick
- knockback can knock enemies into the void
- players collide with corners between 2+ rooms, probably wontfix
- if pushing up against a wall and moving in the x axis, it is possible to get stuck in the edge between rooms
